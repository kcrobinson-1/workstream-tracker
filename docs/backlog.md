# Backlog

Captured-but-unplanned work for workstream-tracker. Entries
graduate into plan-tree nodes when picked up; format and
lifecycle live in [`../spec/backlog.md`](../spec/backlog.md).

### repo-rooted-doc-links

**Status:** Open

Repo-rooted markdown link syntax in plan and spec docs.

Cross-doc links currently use file-relative paths like
`../../../design/vision.md`, which read poorly from deeply
nested plan docs and break when files move. The blocker is
that standard markdown resolves unprefixed paths relative to
the source file, leading `/` resolves to host root on GitHub,
and full URLs are bloated. One option among several: extend
the `{spec_root}` substitution mechanism in
`scripts/assemble.sh` with a sibling `{repo_root}` placeholder
applied to in-repo docs at write time.
